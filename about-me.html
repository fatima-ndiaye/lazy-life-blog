            <h2 class="">My name is Jane and I have embraced my laziness</h2>

            <p class="about-me-text"><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought
                that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. Things were terrible. I
                had a job that I hated, a boss that I hated a home that I didn't want to live in, and I was always stressed.
            </p>

            <h3 >How I turned things around</h3>
            <p class="about-me-text">I was on the verge of a breakdown when, I decided I would make my minutes meaningful by embracing my laziness.
                And by doing so, I was able to write, meditate, and floss daily. I was able to establish evening/morning routines, eat
                better, and read more.<strong>I used my laziness to trick myself into changing for the better</strong>. 
                To make my minutes more meaningful and create amazing habits that last.
            </p>

            <h3>Now I live the lazy life</h3>
            <p class="about-me-text"><strong> key to happiness isn't money or possessions </strong>– it's having the free time to enjoy life. Happiness comes from within.
                When you slow down and smell the roses, the joy of laziness will set you free.
                Being lazy isn't as simple as it seems. I've spent a lifetime perfecting laziness.
                But if you work at it long enough and hard enough, you can turn laziness into an art form.
                To spend such a precious slice of existence in this dimension working hard and stressing out is a foolish waste of time 
                and energy. With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how
                others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this blog!
                <strong>Be lazy and enjoy it</strong> – you'll live longer and pay less taxes.
